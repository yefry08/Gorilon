# Gorilon
A JavaScript videogame where two gorillas fight with boomerangs!!

This game features two gorillas fighting each other using boomerangs. The gorillas can move left, right, and jump, and they can throw boomerangs at each other. The boomerangs travel in an arc and have a limited range. The game also includes different types of platforms, such as slippery platforms that reduce the gorillas' horizontal velocity.
To further enhance the physics and mechanics, you could consider implementing the following:

Realistic object movement using Newton's laws of motion
Rigid body physics for the gorillas and the boomerangs
Collisions between the boomerangs and the platforms
Power-ups or obstacles that affect the game play
Health or score system to determine the winner of the fight
Animations and sound effects for a more immersive experience
